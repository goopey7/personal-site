I was an intern on the engine team at Rare from July 2024 - August 2025.
We were a cross-project team working on both and Sea of Thieves and Everwild (cancelled). I was treated as a member of team and got to do real meaningful work!
I started working on core engine tech to support VFX and SFX in Everwild.
Then about halfway through the internship I heard about the anti-cheat work we were doing on Sea of Thieves!
It sounded very interesting because it involved some very low level code, so as an intern (whose primary objective is to learn on the job) I was able to say "hey I'm actually really interested in this, can I join?". There's a lot of material out there on how to hack games, but there's less about anti-cheat because how many people have a game like Sea of Thieves to test their discorveries on?

My current appreciation and excitement for low-level programming has mainly been fueled by my time working on our anti-cheat tech in Sea of Thieves.
